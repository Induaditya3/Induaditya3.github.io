            Welcome to my home page!
            <p>
              I've been told that there's world of difference between running a html on Web browser locally and maintaining a website on the website. Latter requires much more effort and you tend to learn a lot.So here I am.

              There are couple of things I've in mind about what sort of filler should be used inside html's body tag.
              (I don't like to fill empty spaces by the gibberish 'lorem ipsum' text.)

              I also feel uneasy about posting things online. Not because it's hard, instead I'm scared of writing things that will stay forever even when I remove it. What if I write something that causes backlash? (Too much?)

              "Why are you doing it?",you ask.

              Simple. To shake off that fear.

              I am a student. I got into programming a year ago and am convinced that it's something, that, if I put enough effort and time, I can do reasonably well.
